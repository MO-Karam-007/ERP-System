## ERP System with Node.js and MySQL

**Introduction**

This project provides a foundation for building a robust and scalable Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system using Node.js and MySQL. The ERP system aims to streamline and automate core business processes, enhancing operational efficiency and data-driven decision making.

**Features**

Absolutely! Here's an updated breakdown of your ERP system's core modules incorporating the new features you mentioned:

**Core Modules**

* **Human Resource Management (HRM):**
    * **Employee Management:**
        * Create and manage employee profiles.
        * Track employee performance through feedback mechanisms
    * **User Management (Enhanced):**
        * Integrate with user authentication.
        * Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on employee roles and permissions (e.g., admins can approve leave requests, users can view financial reports)
    * **Training Management:**
        * Have training programs
        * Manage training materials and completion certificates
* **Attendance Management (New):**
    * Track employee attendance (clock-in/out, breaks, overtime)
* **Vacation Management (New):**
    * Manage employee leave requests (vacation, sick leave, personal leave)
    * Track leave balances and approvals
* **Department Management (New):**
    * Manage organizational structure (departments, sub-departments)
    * Assign employees to departments

**Additional Considerations**

* **Security:** Prioritize security measures to protect sensitive employee data (e.g., access control, data encryption).

**Development**

* Leverage Node.js's asynchronous nature for efficient database interactions.
* Consider using an ORM like Sequelize.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed
    * MySQL database server running
2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MO-Karam-007/ERP-System
   ```
3. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   cd ERP-System
   install-server
   npm run server
   ```
4. **Database Configuration:**
   * Create a MySQL database and user for the ERP system.
   * Update the `config.js` file with your database connection details.
5. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will typically start the server on port 3000 (you can modify this in `config.js`).

**Usage (Example)**

* Access the ERP system through a web browser (e.g., http://localhost:3000) or integrate it with a front-end framework like React or Angular.
